    {{% icon icon-empty %}} **Precautions**
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} *Before each dive*, carefully inspect the waterproof housing's main (backplate) and port O-rings. If the O-ring has any debris, remove it and clean it with fresh water, then dry it using a lint-free soft cloth. 
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} *After cleaning*, each O-ring should be lubricated with waterproof silicone grease. When applying grease to the O-rings, use only a tiny amount. A thin, even layer is sufficient to make the O-rings shine without visible grease patches. Over-lubricating can attract debris and potentially cause leakage.

    {{% icon icon-empty %}} &nbsp;
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} If the housing will not be used for an extended period, remove the O-rings, lubricate them, and store them separately.

    {{% icon icon-exclamation %}} **Note:** Do not forcibly remove or use sharp, hard metal objects to remove the O-rings, as this may damage them or the case groove, leading to water leakage. **DO NOT STRETCH THE O-RINGS!**
    {{% icon icon-exclamation %}} The O-rings for the the ***M33 accessory port***, ***VPS100 opening*** and ***shutter grip plug*** are maintained like the main O-rings.

    {{% icon number-circle-two %}} To install the secondary (housing body) O-ring, first ensure the groove on the housing body is completely dry. Carefully remove all grease from the O-ring without stretching it, then install it into the groove. Please note: even small traces of grease on the O-ring or in the groove can prevent proper installation.
