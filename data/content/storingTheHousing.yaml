    summary: "
After each dive, remove the camera and close the waterproof housing. Soak it in fresh water for 15-30 minutes, operating all buttons and knobs to prevent salt buildup. 
Use compressed air to remove any remaining freshwater from all external cavities of the housing, paying special attention to buttons and knobs. If compressed air is unavailable, position the housing to allow any remaining water to drain naturally by gravity.
Thoroughly clean and dry with a soft cloth."
