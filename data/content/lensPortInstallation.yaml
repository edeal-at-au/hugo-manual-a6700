{{% icon number-circle-one %}} Remove the dust caps from the housing body and the lens port.
{{% icon number-circle-two %}} Check the groove on the housing body and lens port O-ring to ensure there is no damage or debris. Remove the O-ring (avoid stretching it!!!), apply a small amount of silicone grease, and then reinstall it into the groove.
{{% icon number-circle-three %}} Align the lens port's positioning point with the housing body's corresponding point. Push the lens port firmly, then rotate it clockwise until fully secured. If needed, use a screwdriver to install the safety lock pin inside the housing, ensuring you use the correct screwdriver to avoid damaging the screw.
{{% icon number-circle-four %}} Remember to use a tiny amount when applying grease to your O-rings. A thin, even layer is sufficient for the O-rings to shine without any visible grease patches. Over-lubricating can attract debris and potentially interfere with the sealing function of the O-rings.
