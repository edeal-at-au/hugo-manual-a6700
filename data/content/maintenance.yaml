    {{% icon icon-empty %}} **Precautions**
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} *Before each dive*, carefully inspect the waterproof housing's main (backplate) and port O-rings. If the O-ring has any debris, remove it and clean it with fresh water, then dry it using a lint-free soft cloth. 
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} *After cleaning*, each O-ring should be lubricated with waterproof silicone grease. When applying grease to the O-rings, use only a tiny amount. A thin, even layer is sufficient to make the O-rings shine without visible grease patches. Over-lubricating can attract debris and potentially cause leakage.
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} If the housing will not be used for an extended period, remove the O-rings, lubricate them, and store them separately.
    {{% icon icon-warning %}} All housing O-rings must be replaced at least once a year or after 50 uses, whichever comes first. 

    {{% icon icon-exclamation %}} **Note:** Do not forcibly remove or use sharp, hard metal objects to remove the O-rings, as this may damage them or the case groove, leading to water leakage. **DO NOT STRETCH THE O-RINGS!**
    {{% icon icon-exclamation %}} The O-rings for the the ***M33 accessory port***, ***VPS100 opening*** and ***shutter grip plug*** are maintained like the main O-rings.

    {{% icon icon-empty %}} **Steps to Maintain the secondary (housing body) O-rings:**
    {{% icon number-circle-one %}} Unless absolutely required, keep the secondary (housing body) O- ring in place. Instead, simply wipe it clean and apply silicone grease without removing it.

    {{% icon icon-empty %}} &nbsp;
    {{% icon number-circle-two %}} To install the secondary (housing body) O-ring, first ensure the groove on the housing body is completely dry. Carefully remove all grease from the O-ring without stretching it, then install it into the groove. Please note: even small traces of grease on the O-ring or in the groove can prevent proper installation.

    {{% icon number-circle-three %}} Press and release the push button several times to distribute the lubricant into the O-ring.
    {{% icon number-circle-four %}} If a push button becomes difficult to press or sticks when depressed, soak the housing in warm, soapy water for a few minutes. Then, operate the push button to restore functionality.
    {{% icon icon-exclamation %}} To prevent the buildup of salt, sand, or debris, flush the push buttons with fresh, clean water after every use. While submerging the housing, depress each push button to ensure proper cleaning.
